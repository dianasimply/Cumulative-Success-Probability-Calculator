This tool computes the chance of reaching a certain number of successes over several iterations. Just enter the success rate, the number of successes you need, and your target iteration. The graph will show iterations from 0 to twice your target (with your target in the center) and mark your target with a vertical green line. Optionally, you can choose to display points at a set interval.
